<h2 style="text-align:center; "> Day 17 - 7th Nov</h2>

<h3 style="text-align:center; "> Lakes Entrance - Sale - Yarram. </h3>


 We thought was our final distingation for the day would be Sale. Though pleasant, Sale is another large regional town and it just did't inspire us to stay.
<br />
We drove on to our next planned stay at Yarram. It was love at first sight.

The Yarram community and Heesco Khosnaran, who is a Melbourne based street artist, combined to install 24 murals on the buildings in and around Yarram. This has lead to a "street art" inspired rerenaissance for the previously fading village.

 <h2 style="text-align:center; "> Day 19 - 9th Nov</h2>

<h3 style="text-align:center; "> Yarram to Inverloch. </h3>


Leaving Yarram today, we took the senic route, with our first stop being in the little village of Fish Creek. The small rural village is undergoing a renewal lead by artist's studios and to die for coffee shops. After a few delectable pastries from the "Little Oberon" cafe we set off to Inverloch.

Inverloch being only 150km from downtown Melboure and is a major holiday destination. The caravan park where we are parked up is humongous. Half is a large family resort style van park. It is fully fenced and full of happy screaming kids. The other half is sites set amongst nature.  It is cheaper, not so crowded and way more tranquil.
<br />

The main notable natural feature of Inverloch is the rock formation known as the Eagles Nest Rock.

<h3 style="text-align:center; ">  A day in Inverloch. </h3>

Walked up town, did our washing and walked around the beach front.

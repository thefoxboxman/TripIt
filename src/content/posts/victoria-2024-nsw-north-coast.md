  After a hectic month or so of visitors etc we packed up and headed off at 9am. It felt great to be back on the road.

  We checked into the Discovery Park for 2 nights.

<h2 style="text-align:center; "> Day 2 - 23rd Oct</h2>

<h3 style="text-align:center; "> Ballina - Byron Bay - Killin Falls </h3>  


  Up early morning to photograph the rocks, headlands and waves north of Ballina up to Lenox Head. This area is paradise. Awesome scenery. Goldilocks weather.

  Afterwards we headed up to Byron Bay arriving about 9.00am. We didn't go anywhere near town, just up to the lighthouse at Cape Byron. The place was heaving with people. Mostly joggers and walkers. And mostly foreign tourist judging by the variety of languages we overheard.

  Leaving Byron Bay to the trendy set we headed into the hinterland to visit the Killen Falls.

<h2 style="text-align:center; "> Day 3 - 24th Oct</h2>

<h3 style="text-align:center; "> Ballina - Brooms Head - Woolgoolga - Coffs Harbour - South West Rocks. </h3>

 From Ballina we headed to Brooms Head further south along the coast. Not to the actual town, but up a dirt road behind the coastal wetland to photograph a feature in the salt-pans call "The Tree of Life".

 From here it was on to Woolgoolga to stock up on cakes and pastries at the legendary Woopi Bakery.

 We checked into the NMRA Caravan Park (Resort) at South West Rocks. Considering this is not school holidays and it is mid-week the park was full to overflowing with families and kids. And the name suggests it is resort for families. The entertainment facilities for kids are fantastic.
